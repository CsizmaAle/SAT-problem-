# ðŸ§© SAT Problem Solver

A Python-based solver for the **SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) Problem** using multiple algorithms.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Structure

- **`copilot3.py`** â€“ Implements three SAT-solving algorithms: **DP, DPLL, and Resolution**.  
  - Reads input from `input.txt` and writes results to `output.txt`.

- **`copilot3_completare.py`** â€“ Generates random sets of clauses and saves them in `input.txt`.

- **`cod_robi.py`** â€“ Uses the most effective SAT-solving algorithm (**DP, DPLL, or Resolution**) based on the input set.  
  - Saves results in `sat_results.txt`.

- **`cod_robi2.py`** â€“ Generates clause sets, solves them using **all three algorithms**, and compares results.  
  - Saves outputs in `sat_results_comparison.txt`.
