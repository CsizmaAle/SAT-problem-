# SAT-problem-
A solver for Sat Problem in Python.  
The file copilot3.py contains all 3 algorithms: dp, dpll, resolution. It reads from input.txt and saves results in output.txt.  
The file copilot3_completare.py contains an algorithm which generates sets of clauses and saves them in input.txt.  

There is a second solver (cod_robi.py) that uses the most effective algorithm (dp/dpll/resolution) for a set. 
The third solver (cod_robi2.py) generates sets of clauses, solves them using all 3 algorithms and saves results in .... file.
